Below are the issues with the ODBCDemo application.
I've corrected them and run against a MySql ODBC driver.
Source is uploaded and output from run is in odbcdemo.out.


1)hdbc is not initialized before call to SQLConnect.
Can do this :
 rc = SQLAllocConnect(henv, &hdbc);
or this:
 rc - SQLAllocHandle(SQL_HANDLE_DBC, henv, &hdbc);

before call to SQLConnect

2)rc = SQLConnect (hdbc, (SQLCHAR*)uid, SQL_NTS, (SQLCHAR*)pwd, SQL_NTS);
This line doesn't have the DSN.  Should be:
rc = SQLConnect (hdbc, driver, SQL_NTS,(SQLCHAR*)uid, SQL_NTS, (SQLCHAR*)pwd, SQL_NTS);

3) If invalid handle SQLError goes into infinite loop:
Change 
if (rc != SQL_NO_DATA_FOUND) {
to:
if (rc != SQL_NO_DATA_FOUND && rc != SQL_INVALID_HANDLE) {
